- Accent color: Pale rose (#D8BFD8) to complement the lavender and add a subtle visual interest. Chosen for medium saturation and brightness in order to act as an accent.

- Well-defined panels with subtle borders to separate different sections.
- Subtle animations for transitions and loading states to avoid distractions.
